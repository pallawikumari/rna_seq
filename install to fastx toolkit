A) Install Xcode on your system (See earlier post)
B) Install Fink on your system (See earlier post)
- install the following fink packages:md5deep and pkgconfig
- "fink install md5deep" (needed for bfast install)
- "fink install pkgconfig" (needed for fastx-toolkit install)
C) Install Git on your system (http://git-scm.com/)
D) Create a $PATH Directory and update this directory in your .profile (See earlier post for instructions)
- In my case "$HOME/local/bin"

1) Install FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/)

Instructions:
- Go to download page and download the following:
a) fastx_toolkit-0.0.13.tar.bz2
b) libgtextutils-0.6.tar.bz2
- Move both to ngs/applications folder and unpack both packages
- In Terminal navigate the libgtextutils folder "cd ngs/applications/libtestutils-0.6"
- Install the package as follows: 
./configure
make 
sudo make install (this will ask for your password, must be admin level privileged set)

- Move to fastx_toolkit folder "cd ../fastx_toolkit-0.0.13"
- Install the package as follows: 
./configure --prefix=$HOME/local/bin
make
make install

- Test install by typing "fastx_uncollapser -h", this should pop up a usage documentation for this app

2) Install Bfast, DNAA, and Breakway


Instructions:
a) In Terminal navigate to ngs/applications
b) Get current Bfast version from Git (restart Terminal after git installation)
- type "git clone git://bfast.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/bfast/bfast"
- this will create a folder called "bfast" in the current directory
- Move into the directory "cd bfast"
- Install bfast by typing the following:
sh autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install (requests a password with admin level privileges)

- Test install and check current version by typing "bfast" in Terminal

c) Navigate back to ngs directory by typing "cd ../"
d) Get current version of DNAA from Git
- type "git clone git://dnaa.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/dnaa/dnaa dnaa"
- this will create a directory named "dnaa" in the current directory (ngs/applications)
- move into the the dnaa directory by typing "cd dnaa"
e) Because this package depends on both BFAST and SAMTOOLS you need to provide links to these application directories even though you already have them in a $PATH directory (/usr/local/bin and $HOME/local/bin repectively)
- create a link to the BFAST package you just installed by typing "ln -s ../bfast bfast"
- create a link to your current SAMTOOLS package by typing "ln -s ../samtools-0.1.8 samtools"
f) Install DNAA by typing the following: 
sh autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install (requests a password with admin level privileges)

g) Download current version of BREAKWAY from sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/breakway/), move it to the ngs/applications folder and unpack it and you should be ready to go
